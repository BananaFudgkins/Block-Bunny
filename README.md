Block Bunny
===========

##About
This is the source code for the unifinished 1.1 update to Block Bunny since I ended development on the game a few days ago. 

##Requirements
To use this source code you will need Eclipse IDE for Java developers, Gradle, and LibGDX. Once you have these things you can import the code by chosing File -> Import -> Existing Gradle Project -> and then find where the projects are located

## Terms of use
I honestly really don't care if you redistribute this in any way. This game already rips off of someone else's source code so you can modify it as you please XD
